#DND Colony Manager
This is a C# command line application meant to handle DND colonies and their various different considerations, such as:
  - Building Income
  - Merchant Arrivals, Value, and Legendary Merchants
  - Special rolls (Things like tavern rumors)
  - Dice rolls : D2, D6, D10, D12, D20, D100
